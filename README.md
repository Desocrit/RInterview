# Calculator

### Operation

The calculator can be used responsively to calculate Either or CombinedWith.
Operation can be selected using the dropdown in the middle.
Operands (either side of this) can be set to values between 0 and 1.
Any other value will trigger validation errors.
Clicking Solve (when the state is dirty and invalid) will produce the solution.

### Extensibility

### TODO

Ultimately, the pure client side implementation has persistence issue,
does not support multiple clients, and lacks users functionality.

A simple nancy/web api server would alleviate this.
